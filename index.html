                <h1>my work experiences</h1>
                <p>So, I've had some pretty cool gigs over the years. I rocked it as a barista and waiter, bringing the coffee magic and serving up tasty delights at Urbanista and Lafluf. From crafting the perfect latte to making sure every customer left with a happy belly, I always brought my A-game. Smiles and top-notch service were my secret ingredients!</p>

                <p>But wait, there's more! I also had a stint as a call center operator at Vertex Delivery. Yep, I was the go-to person for all those customer inquiries and concerns. I tackled 'em with patience and efficiency, making sure each caller hung up with a smile. It was a fast-paced gig that sharpened my communication and problem-solving skills, all while keeping my cool.</p>
                    
                <p>Now, I'm ready for my next adventure. Web development has always intrigued me, and I'm itching to dive right in. From coding to creating awesome websites, I want to bring my creativity and technical skills to the digital world. It's a whole new ballgame, but I'm up for the challenge. Let's make the web a cooler place!</p>
